# 🚀 GitHub Pages Deployment Guide

## ✅ Completed Configurations

Your Quantum Roulette project is now properly configured for GitHub Pages deployment!

### Changes Made:
1. **Fixed Public URL**: Updated package.json build script from `/roulette/` to `/quantum-roulette/` to match your repository name
2. **Updated Dependencies**: Refreshed browserslist database to eliminate build warnings
3. **Built Assets**: Generated production-ready files in `/dist` folder with correct paths
4. **GitHub Actions**: Your existing workflow file `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` is properly configured

## 🛠️ GitHub Pages Setup Instructions

### 1. Enable GitHub Pages
1. Go to your repository: https://github.com/goodtreefaith/quantum-roulette
2. Click on **Settings** tab
3. Scroll down to **Pages** section in the left sidebar
4. Under **Source**, select **Deploy from a branch**
5. Choose **gh-pages** branch (this will be created by the GitHub Action)
6. Click **Save**

### 2. Verify Deployment
After pushing changes to main branch:
1. Go to **Actions** tab in your repository
2. Wait for the "Build and Deploy" workflow to complete (green checkmark)
3. Your site will be available at: **https://goodtreefaith.github.io/quantum-roulette/**

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Build Configuration
```json
"build": "parcel build index.html --public-url /quantum-roulette/"
```

### GitHub Actions Workflow
- Automatically builds on push to `main` branch
- Uses Yarn for dependency management
- Deploys to `gh-pages` branch
- Uses `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v4` action

### Asset Paths
All assets are correctly prefixed with `/quantum-roulette/` including:
- Images and icons
- JavaScript modules
- CSS resources
- SVG files
- WebAssembly files
